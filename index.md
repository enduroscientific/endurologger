## Coming Soon!

**Observations drive scientific discovery**. The EnduroLogger is a highly-flexible, very-low-power, and modular logging system for a wide range of scientific applications to power next-generation observations for your real-world scientific program.

### The system will include:

*   options for various high-precision 24-bit ADC modules capable of sampling over a wide range of output data rates, oversample rates, and filtering schemes.
*   the ability log data from onboard ADCs as well as external sensors that communicate over serial, USB, SPI, I<sup>2</sup>C and more.
*   storage using MicroSD with a maximum capacity of 1 TB.
*   onboard FRAM memory for data buffering.
*   flexible timing options for the low-speed and high-speed clocks, including the possibility of clocking the system with chip-scale atomic clocks for seismic networks and other systems requiring very low drift and precise timing.
*   high-reliability components capable of functioning in the harshest field environments.
*   open-source software libraries to support your project code so the system works exactly like you want it to work.
*   plus much more!

### The system will include:

*   the ability log data from onboard ADCs as well as external sensors that communicate over serial, USB, I2C and more.
*   options for a variety of modular ADC boards that can sample over a wide range of output data rates and oversample rates.
*   available timing using chip-scale atomic clocks for seismic network applications and other systems requiring very-low-drift and precise timing.
*   plus much more!

### The system will include:

*   the ability log data from onboard ADCs as well as external sensors that communicate over serial, USB, SPI, I<sup>2</sup>C and more.
*   options for a variety of modular 24-bit ADC modules that can sample over a wide range of output data rates and oversample rates.
*   available timing modules including chip-scale atomic clocks for seismic networks and other systems requiring very low drift and precise timing.
*   components capable of functioning in the harshest field environments.
*   open-source software libraries to support your project code so the system works exactly like you want it to work.
*   plus much more!
